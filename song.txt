Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom

This is the last time I'll cry lullabies
All night can't sleep
I hear the floors creak
I feel shadows in my room
My friends find another bruise
I might end up on the news
I just don't know what to do
God I'm calling you
Send an angel send two
I want a move but I'm trapped in the outer room
I know you hear me clearly I'm weary
Come and fill me with your power heal me

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal, I'm ready to lose control
Take everything you need, take every part of me
Give me some room to breathe, before I lose control

I got to get away
Got to break away
Save me
Got to find a way
Got to break the chains
Take me
Before I lose control
Before I lose control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible

I'm tired so tired of walking through this fire
If you want to find me I'll be here in my room
I'm thinking you're drinking,
Need to get out before you start swinging
Wish I could show you all the pain inside me

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal, I'm ready to lose control
Take everything you need, take every part of me
Give me some room to breathe, before I lose control

I got to get away
Got to break away
Save me
Got to find a way
Got to break the chains
Take me
Before I lose control
Before I lose control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible

It seems impossible
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
For me to lose control
Crying and hiding this feeling
Running and fighting for freedom
It seems impossible

It seems impossible
For me to let this go
Feel like an animal

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal, I'm ready to lose control
Take everything you need, take every part of me
Give me some room to breathe, before I lose control

It seems impossible
For me to let this go
Feel like an animal

It seems impossible
It's not impossible

It seems impossible
For me to let this go
It seems impossible
It's not impossible
